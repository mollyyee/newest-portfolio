	<p> I participated in a hackathon last weekend, and won 1st place with Project Chime. In honor of sexual assault awareness month, my team wanted to show the relevance of sexual assault and empower those affected by it to share their stories. </p>

<div class = "boxwhy">
<div class = "margin"> 
	<div class = "subtitle"> 1. the issue </div>
	<div id = "whytext"> 
	<p> Sexual violence is a sensitive subject matter. Much discourse in this area still revolves around whether or not sexual harassment, a form of sexual violence, even exists. To the general public that does acknowledge sexual violence, the subject for the most part still remains a far off and irrelevant issue to those not affected. 
	</p>
	<p> When survivors do overcome personal trauma and numerous other hurdles that prevent them from speaking up, they are met with more barriers: they aren't believed, their stories are belittled, and they even get deemed whistleblowers and complainers. </p>
	<p> If survivors have no listeners, then their stories lose impact. If people don't realize the realness of sexual violence, they will not listen. </p>
	<p> Therefore, I wanted to do two things in the hackathon. One, show people that sexual violence is a real issue. And two, give survivors a space to safely tell their storiesâ€” in other words, create a place where people are compassionately listening. </p>
	</div>
	</div>
	</div>

<div class = "box2">
<div class = "margin"> 
	<div class = "subtitle"> 2. the process </div>
	<p> The hackathon gave us 24 hours to promote positive social norms. My team spent the first 4 hours identifying a legitimate problem. </p>
	</div>
<div class = "margin"> 
	<img class = "blockimg" src = "./assets/stickies.jpg">
	<p> After deciding that we wanted to address the issue of sexual violence survivors speaking up about their experiences, our first step was to deeply understand  both the sentiment of the general public around this subject area, and the experience of the sexual assault survivor. </p>
	<p> For the general public, it seemed that for the most part, statistics of how many people are affected by sexual violence does not help reify the issue. Therefore, "educating" the public doesn't work- because the existing types of education are impersonal. If an issue presented doesn't personally affect someone's life, it's less likely to be acknowledged as a real issue. Therefore, our brainstorming process focused on making the issue real. </p>
	<p id = "emphasis"> Therefore, we ideated around two goals: 1) how might we make the issue of sexual assault real to the general public? and 2) how might we make people listen to survivor testimonies? 

	</div>
	</div>

<div class = "box">
<div class = "margin"> 
	<div class = "subtitle"> 3. brainstorming </div>
	<p> As a team, we individually came up with as many ideas as possible within 10 minutes. </p>
	</div>
	<img class = "longblock" src = "./assets/brainstorming.jpg">
<div class = "margin"> 
	<p>
	Then converged on one idea for each goal. We approached the problem of making the issue of sexual violence real to the general public by show people how many of their friends experience any forms of harassment or violence. Our solution to this problem was a hypothetical survey on Facebook, where Facebook would launch a survey sensitively and carefully asking users for anonymous info on whether they've experienced certain forms of sexual violence. After gathering that information, we show each user how many of their friends have experienced sexual violence. 
	</p>
	<p> Then to make people listen, we wanted to make a platform that would make it easy to hear the voices of those who experience sexual violence. Survivors submit their experiences onto this platform, and can choose which quotes they want anonymously displayed for the public to see. At this point, we wanted our visual interface to symbolically show that speaking up was a positive thing. So we imagined that each story would show up as a form of light that could be clicked on- and the more survivors submit stories, the interface would light up. </p>

	</div>

<div class = "box2">
<div class = "margin"> 
	<div class = "subtitle"> 4. userflows </div>
	<p> After settling on prototyping these two ideas above, we began to flesh the user experience. </p>
	</div>
	<img class = "longblock" src = "./assets/userflows.png">
	<div class = "margin">
	<p> We considered the needs of the user after each step, throwing around the idea of creating a support group for the survivor.  </p>
	</div>
	</div>

<div class = "box">
<div class = "margin"> 
	<div class = "subtitle"> 5. solution </div>
	<p> Finally, after finishing our user flows, my team and I carefully decided what and how to ask Facebook users in our survey. Then, I used Sketch to create mockups for what the Facebook survey would look for, and my teammate coded the mockups with Framer. You can take a look at the Framer prototype <a href = "framer"> here</a>. </p>
	</div>
	<img id = "longimage" src = "./assets/chimescreens.jpg">
	<div class = "margin">
	<p> For the platform where people could listen to snippets of the survivors' stories, I created a visual representation of the platform with Aftereffects, as shown below. </p>
	</div>
	<div class = "containgifs">
	<img id = "gif" src = "./assets/gif1.gif">
	<img id = "gif" src = "./assets/gif2.gif">
	<img id = "gif" src = "./assets/gif3.gif">
	</div>
	<div class = "margin">
	<p> Each bubble of light represents a survivor's story. The more survivors submit their anonymous stories, the more light there will be on the interface. Listeners can come onto the platform and click through bubbles, which each reveal small tweet-like snippets of each survivor's stories. </p>

	<p> This is my favorite project because I learned that design can be used to empower people and change social norms.
