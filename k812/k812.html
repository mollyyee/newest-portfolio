	<p> K@812 is a nonprofit business incubator for local restaurant entrepreneurs. As a business analyst, I worked with clients to help see what they needed. I provided research, giving them competitive analysis and pricing recommendations. For two clients, I designed logos, took photos of the products, and created their websites. </p>

	<p> Designing for others is all about representing another's voice through aesthetics. I learned to not get attached too my designs because chances are, my clients might not like them first time around. Design with the the client's story in mind.
